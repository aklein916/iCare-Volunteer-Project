My family instilled in me the Jewish idea of 'Tikun Olam', repairing the world. I have taken this value with me through many stages of my life, and feel it is my responsibility as a citizen of the world to help those less fortunate and strive to make the world a better place for all."}, {"name": "Brittany Branson", "age": 25, "cause": "Art and Culture", "photo_url": "https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrinknp_400_400/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAWyAAAAJDM3ZTljZjE1LTM0YTUtNDk5ZS04MTQxLWI0OTZjYjk5ZDlhMA.jpg", "story": "I have always loved the arts, and have fond memories of going to art class or heading into NYC to see Broaway shows with my mom. After becoming a public charter school teacher after college, I learned first hand how important it is for young kids to have access to quality arts education and experiences. I volunteer to ensure every kid in DC does!"}
